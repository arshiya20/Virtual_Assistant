# Virtual Assistant

Virtual assistants are the software programs which are capable of listening to the user and responding it accordingly. 
They are being used to perform various tasks of our day-to-day life which will ultimately lead to make life easy. This engages the ability to communicate socially through natural 
language processing, holding and analyzing data within the context of the user. It is predicted that new technologies may soon make the idea of virtual personal assistants a 
common usage assistant for everyone.
Experiments conducted on this system, combined with user testing, have provided evidence that a basic program with natural language processing algorithms in the form of 
a VPA, with basic natural language processing and the ability to function without the need for other type of human input (or programming) may already be viable.
It could be useful for getting a more convenient life and it will be helpful for the people who have disabilities for manual operations.It has been designed to provide a 
user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. 
Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands.
The mass adoption of artificial intelligence in every industry and in userâ€™s everyday lives is fueling the shift towards these type of softwareand in the coming 
times it would become a day-to-day life assistant for managing work for almost everyone.
